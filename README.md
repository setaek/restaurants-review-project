## Overview
in this project given by udacity i converted  a static webpage to a mobile web application. i make the webpage more responsive on diffrent displays and accessible for screen reader. and i also added a service worker to create offline experience to the users.


## How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer:

`$ git clone https://github.com/setaek/restaurants-review-project.git`

and follow the instructions below:

* In the repository folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal (like Git Bash, Cygwin or the Windows terminal), check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. You can now see the live site.
